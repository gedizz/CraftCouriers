GFX:
 - Change minnesota logo to not have county outlines
 - use craft couriers bronze or marigold for pin
 - maybe orange for c in car logo
 - move nav logo C next to home and change color for both to white
 - fix header image pixelation



 NAV--
  - change href to go to proper location and change textContent to proper names
  - drop down for About Us > Our Passion > Delivery Zone > FAQ > Contact Us
  - add cart to menu
  - maybe try a solid bg and adjust image down

  HOW DOES IT WORK
   - padding 
   - make the car drive

 ARe you in the zone --
  - #zip-inside-range needs more content
  -- future feature: If in x prox of brewery, maybe let them order still
  - add form validation
  - smaller text on #zip-outside-range
  - raise opacity to socials on mobile
  - form on mobile zooms in - force it to stay
